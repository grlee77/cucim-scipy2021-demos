# cucim-scipy2021-demos

This scripts correspond to demos given during our SciPy 2021 talk:
*cuCIM - A GPU image I/O and processing library*

Due to large files sizes, the data itself is not stored in this repository, but
the code can be inspected in closer detail than while watching the youtube
video.

Each script should have a comment at the top indicating the original source of
the data used in the demos. These datasets are all freely available.

Downloading this data indepenently and updating paths used in the scripts
accordingly will be required to run the demos.
